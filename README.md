# Collector Tutorial

This project is designed to be part of an interactive tutorial in game programming
using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

After the tutorial, check out the [challenges list](challenges.html) for some 
additional features you can try adding on your own!

For a deeper introduction to Godot Engine, I recommend [the &ldquo;Your First Game&rdquo; tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) from the Godot Engine site.
