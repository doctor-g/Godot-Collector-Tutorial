# Collector Tutorial

This project is designed to be part of an interactive tutorial in game programming
using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

## Getting ready for the tutorial

Make sure you [download version 3.2 of Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download).
You should download the 64-bit &ldquo;standard version&rdquo;. (If you are
using a rather old computer, the 32-bit version will also work, but most
computers running now are 64-bit.)

Extract the executable Godot Engine file from the ZIP file you downloaded.
You can just put this on your Desktop or someplace similar. There is nothing
to install: Godot Engine simply runs from that executable.

Download the source code ZIP of the latest release of this tutorial
[from the releases page](https://github.com/doctor-g/Godot-Collector-Tutorial/releases).
Those are the files you will need for the tutorial, so unzip them to a convenient
location, such as the Desktop.

Open the tutorial by running Godot Engine, choosing Import,
and then selecting the `project.godot` file in the folder where you extracted
the tutorial files.



## After the tutorial...

After the tutorial, check out the [challenges list](challenges.html) for some 
additional features you can try adding on your own!

For a deeper introduction to Godot Engine, I recommend [the &ldquo;Your First Game&rdquo; tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) from the Godot Engine site.
