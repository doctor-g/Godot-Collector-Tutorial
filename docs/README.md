# Star Collector: A Two-Part Game Development Tutorial

This project is designed to be part of an interactive workshop on game programming
using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

## Part 1

### Getting Ready

Make sure you [download version 3.2 of Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download).
You should download the 64-bit &ldquo;standard version&rdquo;. (If you are
using a rather old computer, the 32-bit version will also work, but most
computers running now are 64-bit.)

Extract the executable Godot Engine file from the ZIP file you downloaded.
You can just put this on your Desktop or someplace similar. There is nothing
to install: Godot Engine simply runs from that executable.

Download the source code ZIP of the latest release of this tutorial
[from the releases page](https://github.com/doctor-g/Godot-Collector-Tutorial/releases).
Those are the files you will need for the workshop, so unzip them to a convenient
location, such as the Desktop.

Open the game template by running Godot Engine, choosing Import,
and then selecting the `project.godot` file in the folder where you extracted
the tutorial files. Feel free to click the "Play" button on the toolbar to 
try the game template.

If you got this far, congratulations! You are ready for the workshop!
I look forward to seeing you at the meeting, where we will work through a few
exercises on how to add features to the template.


### After the workshop

After the workshop, check out the [post-workshop challenges list](Challenges-1.md) for some 
additional features you can try adding on your own!


## Part 2

Now that you have completed Part 1, we can start talking about
_juiciness_. This is an idea from game development where we take
something relatively simple and make it feel a lot better to play.
We won't change the fundamental gameplay from Part 1: we'll just give
the game some _juice_.

### Getting Ready

If you were part of the original tutorial group, you will need to download
these two files and put them into your project's `assets` folder. 

- <a download="pickup.wav" href="pickup.wav">pickup.wav</a>
- <a download="theme.ogg" href="theme.ogg">theme.ogg</a>

If you have not yet done either tutorial, you can instead [just download the
latest release from the releases
page](https://github.com/doctor-g/Godot-Collector-Tutorial/releases) and unzip
it as described above. The latest release already contains the `pickup.wav` and
`theme.ogg` files.


### After the workshop

[Here is another list of challenges](Challenges-2.md) that you can try after
the tutorial. 

## Additional Free Resources

Game development is a great hobby, and there are lots of skills to explore, such
as programming, art, music, sound effects, and storytelling.
Here are some of my favorite web sites for free next steps in game development:

### Tutorials and Lessons

- [Godot Engine's "Your First Game" tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) provides an excellent introduction to the engine


- [GGJ NEXT (Global Game Jam Next)](https://ggjnext.org/) provides for free [a
  great collection of curriculum videos](https://ggjnext.org/curriculum/) on
  topics including design, art, programming, audio, and production.

- [_Game Design Concepts_](https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/) is essentially a free
  online textbook on game design. The examples are a little dated, but the principles are
  spot on.


### Art Tools

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a free image editor

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a free vector graphics editor


### Audio Tools

- [LMMS](https://lmms.io) is a full-featured digital audio workstation for
  writing music&mdash;the pickup sound and simple theme from this tutorial were
  both made using LMMS.

- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is a free audio editor

- [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co/) is a fun, free, online tool for making
  simple beats that you can bring into your game.

### Free Assets

- [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/) has an amazing collection of public domain
  assets, including 2D art, 3D art, and sound effects. The adventurer and star
  from this tutorial came from Kenney!

- [FreeSound.org](https://freesound.org/) is a great collection of sound effects, including both public domain and attribution-licensed assets

- [Kevin Macleod (Incompetech)](https://incompetech.com/) has a huge collection
 of attribution-licensed music&mdash;he has been a go-to for game jammers for years!

### YouTube Channels

- [My game programming playlist on
  YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL4s8QTahRc11XP1Zn21F0v4CVD3abVKI)
  includes a variety of tutorials, from beginner to advanced topics, focusing on
  [GodotEngine](https://godotengine.org) and [Unreal Engine
  4](https://unrealengine.com).

- [GamesFromScratch](https://www.youtube.com/user/gamefromscratch) regularly
  posts news and reviews of interest to hobbyist game developers

### Jams

Game jams are a great way to practice your skills. A jam gives you a set of constraints and a limited amount of time to get something up and running. You can learn a lot more by finishing lots of small projects than you do by unconstrained exploration.

You can find an excellent list of jams at [itch.io/jams](https://itch.io/jams), and there are often over a hundred going on
at any time.
Here are some of my favorite relevant events:
- [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com), for which I especially enjoy the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; form, in which you have 48 hours to make a game from scratch, including all of the assets.
- [National Game Design Month (NaGaDeMon)](https://nagademon.org/) encourages people to make, play, and talk about games during November.
