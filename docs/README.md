# Introduction

This page provides a two-part introduction to game development using
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org). 
Following this tutorial, you will be able to make your own video game.
Each part of the tutorial includes a set of challenges that you 
can use to test and expand your understanding of the topics.

# Part 1

## Getting Ready

Make sure you [download version 3.2 of Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download).
You should download the 64-bit &ldquo;standard version&rdquo;. If you are
using a rather old computer, the 32-bit version will also work, but most
computers running now are 64-bit.

Extract the executable Godot Engine file from the ZIP file you downloaded.
You can just put this on your Desktop or any convenient location. There is nothing
to install: Godot Engine simply runs from that executable.

Download the source code ZIP of the latest release of this tutorial
[from the releases page](https://github.com/doctor-g/Godot-Collector-Tutorial/releases).
Those are the files you will need for the workshop. You do not need to 
extract the files from the ZIP file; Godot Engine will handle that in the next step.

Run Godot Engine, then choose Import and select the project ZIP file you
downloaded. You will need to make and choose an empty directory in which Godot
will set up the project. Now, you should be able to click the play button (â–¶) in
the toolbar at the top of the screen to run the game template!

If you got this far, congratulations! You are ready for the workshop!


## After the workshop

After the workshop, check out the [post-workshop challenges
list](Challenges-1.md) for some additional features you can try adding on your
own.


# Part 2

Now that you have completed Part&nbsp;1, we can start talking about
_juiciness_. This is a game development idea where we take
something relatively simple and make it feel a lot better to play.
We won't change the fundamental gameplay from Part 1: we'll just give
the game some _juice_.

## After the workshop

[Here is another list of challenges](Challenges-2.md) that you can try after
the tutorial. 


# Additional Free Resources

Game development is a great hobby, and there are lots of skills to explore, such
as programming, art, music, sound effects, and storytelling.
Here are some of my favorite web sites for free next steps in game development:

## Tutorials and Lessons

- [Godot Engine's "Your First Game" tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) provides an excellent introduction to the engine


- [GGJ NEXT (Global Game Jam Next)](https://ggjnext.org/) provides for free [a
  great collection of curriculum videos](https://ggjnext.org/curriculum/) on
  topics including design, art, programming, audio, and production.

- [_Game Design Concepts_](https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/) is essentially a free
  online textbook on game design. The examples are a little dated, but the principles are
  spot on.


## Art Tools

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a free image editor

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a free vector graphics editor


## Audio Tools

- [LMMS](https://lmms.io) is a full-featured digital audio workstation for
  writing music&mdash;the pickup sound and simple theme from this tutorial were
  both made using LMMS.

- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is a free audio editor

- [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co/) is a fun, free, online tool for making
  simple beats that you can bring into your game.

## Free Assets

- [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/) has an amazing collection of public domain
  assets, including 2D art, 3D art, and sound effects. The adventurer and star
  from this tutorial came from Kenney!

- [FreeSound.org](https://freesound.org/) is a great collection of sound
  effects, including both public domain and attribution-licensed assets

- [Kevin Macleod (Incompetech)](https://incompetech.com/) has a huge collection
  of attribution-licensed music&mdash;he has been a go-to for game jammers for
  years!

## YouTube Channels

- [My game programming playlist on
  YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL4s8QTahRc11XP1Zn21F0v4CVD3abVKI)
  includes a variety of tutorials, from beginner to advanced topics, focusing on
  [GodotEngine](https://godotengine.org) and [Unreal Engine
  4](https://unrealengine.com).

- [GamesFromScratch](https://www.youtube.com/user/gamefromscratch) regularly
  posts news and reviews of interest to hobbyist game developers

## Jams

Game jams are a great way to practice your skills. A jam gives you a set of constraints and a limited amount of time to get something up and running. You can learn a lot more by finishing lots of small projects than you do by unconstrained exploration.

You can find an excellent list of jams at [itch.io/jams](https://itch.io/jams), and there are often over a hundred going on
at any time.
Here are some of my favorite relevant events:
- [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com), for which I especially enjoy the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; form, in which you have 48 hours to make a game from scratch, including all of the assets.
- [National Game Design Month (NaGaDeMon)](https://nagademon.org/) encourages people to make, play, and talk about games during November.
