# Collector Tutorial

This project is designed to be part of an interactive workshop on game programming
using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

## Part 1

### Getting Ready

Make sure you [download version 3.2 of Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download).
You should download the 64-bit &ldquo;standard version&rdquo;. (If you are
using a rather old computer, the 32-bit version will also work, but most
computers running now are 64-bit.)

Extract the executable Godot Engine file from the ZIP file you downloaded.
You can just put this on your Desktop or someplace similar. There is nothing
to install: Godot Engine simply runs from that executable.

Download the source code ZIP of the latest release of this tutorial
[from the releases page](https://github.com/doctor-g/Godot-Collector-Tutorial/releases).
Those are the files you will need for the workshop, so unzip them to a convenient
location, such as the Desktop.

Open the game template by running Godot Engine, choosing Import,
and then selecting the `project.godot` file in the folder where you extracted
the tutorial files. Feel free to click the "Play" button on the toolbar to 
try the game template.

If you got this far, congratulations! You are ready for the workshop!
I look forward to seeing you at the meeting, where we will work through a few
exercises on how to add features to the template.


### After the workshop

After the workshop, check out the [post-workshop challenges list](Challenges-1.md) for some 
additional features you can try adding on your own!

For a deeper introduction to Godot Engine, I recommend [the &ldquo;Your First Game&rdquo; tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) from the Godot Engine site.


## Part 2

### Getting Ready

If you were part of the original tutorial group, you will need to download
these two files and put them into your project's `assets` folder:

- [pickup.wav](https://github.com/doctor-g/Godot-Collector-Tutorial/blob/master/assets/pickup.wav)
- [theme.ogg](https://github.com/doctor-g/Godot-Collector-Tutorial/blob/master/assets/theme.ogg)

### After the workshop

[Here is another list of challenges](Challenges-2.md) that you can try after
the tutorial.
